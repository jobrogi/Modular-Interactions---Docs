-[FAB LINK HERE]()


A highly customizable interaction system built for Unreal Engine 5. This plugin provides developers with a modular, extensible foundation for adding interaction logic to actors, complete with dynamic widgets, reusable behavior types, and clean C++/Blueprint integration.

## üîß Features

- üß© Modular parent-class system with built-in interaction logic
- üß† Enum-driven behavior routing (`EActionType`, `EWidgetType`)
- üéõ Dynamic details panel with conditional properties
- üí° Supports both native and custom UMG widget prompts
- üéÆ Input mapping with Enhanced Input support
- üß± Reusable timeline-based actor movement/rotation
- üîÅ One-click setup with previewable widget actor in editor
- üíô Fully Blueprint-compatible with override hooks for custom logic

## üöÄ Getting Started

### 1. Enable Plugin

Go to `Edit > Plugins` and enable the **Modular Interactions** plugin.

---

### 2. Add the Interaction Handler to Your Character

Add the `BP_InteractionHandlerComponent` to **your main character**.  
This component is required and handles most of the core interaction logic. It must be added directly to the player‚Äôs character so the plugin can consistently reference it during interaction.

Once the component is added, you're ready to begin setting up interactables:

- Use `AInteractableActorBase` to define objects that can be interacted with.
- Use `AInteractionRelayActor` to control one or more interactables remotely ‚Äî great for switches, buttons, and other external triggers.

üìå *See the image below for a reference of available classes.*
IE: `InteractableActorBase`, `InteractionRelayActor`

### 3. Configure Interaction Settings

Each interactable actor includes a modular, dynamic details panel for setup:

- **Widget Type**: Choose from Tooltip, Icon Prompt, Radial Progress, or Custom.
- **Action Type**: Choose from Widget Action, Toggle Actor, Custom Event, and more.

üîÑ The panel dynamically updates based on your selections:

- Enabling **Use Built-in Action** exposes pre-wired logic like widget toggling.
- Selecting different **Widget Types** reveals widget-specific options.
- Enabling **Use Animation** displays animation-specific settings.

This system keeps clutter to a minimum and only shows settings that are relevant to your current configuration.

---

### 4. Relay Interactable Actors (Optional)

Relay actors (`AInteractionRelayActor`) are designed to **remotely trigger other interactables**.  
These are ideal for buttons, control panels, switches, and similar use cases.

Relay-specific settings allow you to:

- Link multiple target actors
- Automatically follow or attach to another actor
- Control how it aligns and snaps in the world

üìå *See the image below for an example of relay actor configuration.*

### 5. Hook Up Inputs

Make sure your character has the correct input mappings via **Enhanced Input**.  
Alternatively, you can directly call `FinalInteract()` in custom input setups.

---


---

## üß† How It Works

The plugin routes all interaction logic through the parent class:
```cpp
// Called when player interacts with actor
void AInteractableActorBase::FinalInteract()
{
    PreInteract();
    OnInteract(); // Child classes can override this
}
```
## ‚öôÔ∏è Interactable Actor Settings

These settings are available when working with `AInteractableActorBase`. The panel is dynamic and changes based on selected enum options like `Action Type` and `Widget Type`.

### üß© Main Settings

| Property | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Use Built-in Action** | Enables the default logic for the selected `Action Type`. When disabled, you must implement `OnInteract()` manually. |
| **Action Type** | Determines what kind of built-in behavior to perform. Options include: `Custom Event`, `Widget Action`, `Toggle Actor`, `Timeline Move`, `Timeline Rotate`, and more. |
| **Controlled by Other Interactable** | When enabled, this actor will not run its own interaction logic‚Äîit will wait to be triggered by another actor (like a relay). |
| **Requires Manual Trigger** | Prevents auto-firing on trace/hit detection. Useful for objects that should only trigger through another system. |

---

### üé¨ Animation

| Property | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Use Animation** | Enables animation-related settings (e.g., montage playback). More settings will appear once this is enabled. |

---

### üñº Widget Settings

| Property | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Widget Type** | The visual style for interaction. Options include `Tooltip`, `Radial Progress`, `Press Prompt`, `Icon`, and `Custom`. |
| **Custom Widget Class** | When `Widget Type` is set to `Custom`, assign your custom `UUserWidget` class here. |
| **Widget Offset** | 3D offset of the widget in world or screen space. |
| **Widget Scale** | Scale of the widget in the viewport or 3D space. |
| **Screen Space Type** | Switch between `World` or `Screen` space rendering. |
| **Change Widget Pitch / Roll / Yaw** | Toggles whether to allow rotation of the widget in each axis. |
| **Show Widget Shadows** | Enables basic dynamic shadow casting on the widget. |
| **Interact Text** | The text shown inside the widget (e.g., "Open", "Pick Up", etc.). |

---

### üß© Widget Action Settings

| Property | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Widget to Open** | Only used if `Action Type == Widget Action`. Defines the widget to display during interaction (e.g., inventory, dialogue, panel). |
